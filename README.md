***
- Social media is a place to connect and communicate with all different kinds of people from all walks of life.
- Beeper is an app that lets you connect with other people and talk about anything and everything.

**Planning**
***
* I first started out with the idea of creating an app that was similar to twitter.
* Beeper is an app that favors text more than anything so twitter was a great model.
